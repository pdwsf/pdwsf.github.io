*folklore*

**folklore, a surprise album, is her eighth studio album. During quarantine, she conceived Folklore as *"a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness"*. Instead of a pop upbeat music, folklore consists of mellow ballads driven by neo-classical instruments, pursuing indie folk, alternative rock, and electroacoustic styles. Influenced by loneliness during quarantine, she explores themes of escapism, empathy, nostalgia and romanticism in the album, using a set of characters, fictional narratives, and story arcs, in contrast to the autobiographical tone of her previous projects. The title was inspired by the lasting legacy of folk songs, whereas its visual aesthetic reflects cottagecore. This album won Album of the Year in the 2021 grammys.**

My favorite song: `cardigan`
